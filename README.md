# Binary Classification of Biomimicry Papers Using SciBERT for the NASA PeTaL Project

The NASA PeTaL (Periodic Table of Life) Project is an open source artificial intelligence design tool that leverages data and information from nature and technology to advance biomimicry R&D.

## Running SciBERT

## More Information


## Future Work
 * Divide snorkel into multiple models that each handle a subset of functions to increase computing efficiency.
 * Write rules for the remaining 60 biomimicry functions.
 * Include 'regular expression' labeling functions to increase coverage.
