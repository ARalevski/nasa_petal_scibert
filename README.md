# Binary Classification of Biomimicry Papers Using SciBERT for the NASA PeTaL Project

The NASA PeTaL (Periodic Table of Life) Project is an open source artificial intelligence design tool that leverages data and information from nature and technology to advance biomimicry R&D.

## Overview
The aim of this project is to utilize SciBERT to identify biomimicry papers in the scientific literature. 

## Files
```scibert_binary_classification``` trains the model for binary (Y/N) classification of biomimicry papers.
```binary_labeler_scibert.py``` main file to train SciBERT on biomimicry papers.
