thus direct exchange of gases between submerged tissues and the environment is strongly impeded. aerenchyma provides a low-resistance internal pathway for gas transport between shoot and root extremities. by this pathway, o2 is supplied to the roots and rhizosphere, while co2, ethylene, and methane move from the soil to the shoots and atmosphere. diffusion is the mechanism by which gases move within roots of all plant species, but significant pressurized through-flow occurs in stems and rhizomes of several emergent and floating-leaved wetland plants. through-flows can raise o2 concentrations in the rhizomes close to ambient levels. in general, rates of flow are determined by plant characteristics such as capacity to generate positive pressures in shoot tissues, and resistance to flow in the aerenchyma, as well as environmental conditions affecting leaf-to-air gradients in humidity and temperature. o2 diffusion in roots is influenced by anatomical, morphological and physiological characteristics, and environmental conditions. roots of many (but not all) wetland species contain large volumes of aerenchyma (e.g. root porosity can reach 55%), while a barrier impermeable to radial o2 loss (rol) often occurs in basal zones. these traits act synergistically to enhance the amount of o2 diffusing to the root apex and enable the development of an aerobic rhizosphere around the root tip, which enhances root penetration into anaerobic substrates. the barrier to rol in roots of some species is induced by growth in stagnant conditions, whereas it is constitutive in others. an inducible change in the resistance to o2 across the hypodermis/exodermis is hypothesized to be of adaptive significance to plants inhabiting transiently waterlogged soils. knowledge on the anatomical basis of the barrier to rol in various species is scant. nevertheless, it has been suggested that the barrier may also impede influx of: (i) soil-derived gases, such as co2, methane, and ethylene; (ii) potentially toxic substances (e.g. reduced metal ions) often present in waterlogged soils; and (iii) nutrients and water. lateral roots, that remain permeable to o2, may be the main surface for exchange of substances between the roots and rhizosphere in wetland species. further work is required to determine whether diversity in structure and function in roots of wetland species can be related to various niche habitats.", "isOpenAccess": false, "fullDocLink": "", "petalID": 33, "doi": "10.1046/J.1365-3040.2003.00846.X", "level1": ["manipulate_solids_liquids_gases_energy"], "level2": ["distribute_or_expel _resources"], "level3": ["distribute_gases"], "isBiomimicry": "Y", "url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-3040.2003.00846.x", "mag_terms": ["aerenchyma", "aerenchyma formation", "rhizosphere", "nutrient", "exodermis", "shoot", "soil water", "rumex palustris", "botany", "chemistry"], "species": ["plants", "vascular plants"], "absolute_relevancy": [0.022556390977443, 0.0], "relative_relevancy": [1.0, 0.0]},

which is the color produced by micro- or nano-structures, and is bright and dazzling. the most common mechanisms of structural colors are film interference, diffraction grating, scattering and photonic crystals. biological colors are mainly derived from film interference, which includes thin-film and multi-film interference. the diffraction grating mechanism is found in, for example, seed shrimp, mollusk haliotis glabra and the hibiscus trionum flower. scattering includes coherent and incoherent scattering. well-known examples of coherent scattering include colors produced by brilliant iridescent butterfly wing scales and avian feather barbules, such as the peacock's tail. examples of colors produced by photonic crystal structures include opal in beetles and iridescent spines in the sea mouse. coloration changes occur through structural changes for camouflage, predation, signal communication and sex choice. this paper presents an overview of lessons from nature and various

specialized for housing ants and often food to ants. in return, the inhabiting ants protect plants against herbivores and sometimes provide them with nutrients. here, we review recent advances in ant\u2013plant symbioses, focusing on three areas. first, the nutritional ecology of plant-ants, which is based not only on plant-derived food rewards, but also on inputs from other symbiotic partners, in particular fungi and possibly bacteria. food and protection are the most important \u2018currencies\u2019 exchanged between partners and they drive the nature and evolution of the relationships. secondly, studies of conflict and cooperation in ant\u2013plant symbioses have contributed key insights into the evolution and maintenance of mutualism, particularly how partner-mediated feedbacks affect the specificity and stability of mutualisms. there is little evidence that mutualistic ants or plants are under selection to cheat, but the costs and benefits of ant\u2013plant interactions do vary with environmental factors, making them vulnerable to natural or anthropogenic environmental change. thus, thirdly, ant\u2013plant symbioses should be considered good models for investigating the effects of global change on the outcome of mutualistic interactions.", "isOpenAccess": true, "fullDocLink":

structure-function, tissue distribution, and associated inherited diseases.", "abstract": "the epithelial sodium channel (enac) is composed of three homologous subunits and allows the flow of na(+) ions across high resistance epithelia, maintaining body salt and water homeostasis. enac dependent reabsorption of na(+) in the kidney tubules regulates extracellular fluid (ecf) volume and blood pressure by modulating osmolarity. in multi-ciliated cells, enac is located in cilia and plays an essential role in the regulation of epithelial surface liquid volume necessary for cilial transport of mucus and gametes in the respiratory and reproductive tracts respectively. the subunits that form enac (named as alpha, beta, gamma and delta, encoded by genes scnn1a, scnn1b, scnn1g, and scnn1d) are members of the enac/degenerin superfamily. the earliest appearance of enac orthologs is in the genomes of the most ancient vertebrate taxon, cyclostomata (jawless vertebrates) including lampreys, followed by earliest representatives of gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) including cartilaginous sharks. among euteleostomi (bony vertebrates), actinopterygii (ray finned-fishes) branch has lost enac genes. yet, most animals in the sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish) branch including tetrapoda, amphibians and amniotes (lizards, crocodiles, birds, and mammals), have four enac paralogs. we compared the sequences of enac orthologs from 20 species and established criteria for the identification of enac orthologs and paralogs, and their distinction from other members of the enac/degenerin superfamily, especially asic family. differences between enacs and asics are summarized in view of their physiological functions and tissue distributions. structural motifs that are conserved throughout vertebrate enacs are highlighted. we also present a comparative overview of the genotype-phenotype relationships in inherited diseases associated with enac mutations, including multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism (pha1b), liddle syndrome, cystic fibrosis-like disease and essential hypertension.", "isOpenAccess": true, "fullDocLink": "http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4756657?pdf=render",

(2) a muscle-to-muscle conduction causes the simultaneous contraction of the ampulla or the podial retractor muscles.

from those of the ambient environment. the term 'subaerial biofilm' (sab) was coined for microbial communities that develop on solid mineral surfaces exposed to the atmosphere. subaerial biofilms are ubiquitous, self-sufficient, miniature microbial ecosystems that are found on buildings, bare rocks in deserts, mountains, and at all latitudes where direct contact with the atmosphere and solar radiation occurs. subaerial biofilms on exposed terrestrial surfaces are characterized by patchy growth that is dominated by associations of fungi, algae, cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. inherent subaerial settlers include specialized actinobacteria (e.g. geodermatophilus), cyanobacteria and microcolonial fungi. individuals within sab communities avoid sexual reproduction, but cooperate extensively with one another especially to avoid loss of energy and nutrients. subaerial biofilm metabolic activity centres on retention of water, protecting the cells from fluctuating environmental conditions and solar radiation as well as prolonging their vegetative life. atmospheric aerosols, gases and propagatory particles serve as sources of nutrients and inoculum for these open communities. subaerial biofilms induce chemical and physical changes to rock materials, and they penetrate the mineral substrate contributing to rock and mineral decay, which manifests itself as bio-weathering of rock surfaces. given their characteristic slow and sensitive growth, sab may also serve as bioindicators of atmospheric and/or climate change.", "isOpenAccess": true, "fullDocLink":

chemists, biochemists, and microbiologists for many decades. we begin this review with a description of the biology of acetogenesis. then, we provide a short history of the important discoveries that have led to the identification of the key components and steps of this usual mechanism of co and co(2) fixation. in this historical perspective, we have included reflections that hopefully will sketch the landscape of the controversies, hypotheses, and opinions that led to the key experiments and discoveries. we then describe the properties of the genes and enzymes involved in the pathway and

integument represents an evolutionary compromise between the needs for mechanical protection and those of sensing the environment and regulating the exchange of materials and energy. fibrous keratins evolved as a means of strengthening the integument while simultaneously providing a structural support for lipids, which comprise the principal barrier to cutaneous water efflux in terrestrial taxa. whereas lipids are of fundamental importance to water barriers, the efficacy of these barriers depends in many cases on structural features that enhance or maintain the integrity of function. amphibians are exceptional among tetrapods in having very little keratin and a thin stratum corneum. thus, effective lipid barriers that are present in some specialized anurans living in xeric habitats are external to the epidermis, whereas lipid barriers of amniotes exist as a lipid-keratin complex within the stratum corneum. amphibians prevent desiccation of the epidermis and underlying tissues either by evaporating water from a superficial aqueous film, which must be replenished, or by shielding the stratum corneum with superficial lipids. water barrier function in vertebrates generally appears to be relatively fixed, although various species have ;plasticity' to adjust the barrier effectiveness facultatively. while it is clear that both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation can account for covariation between environment and skin resistance to water efflux, studies of the relative importance of these two phenomena are few. fundamental mechanisms for adjusting

(leguminosae), the sensitive plant (roblin 1976), and many other tropical legumes the leaflets of mimosa fold within a few seconds following gentle stimuli. raindrops initiate thigmonastic responses in other tropical plants (von denffer et al. 1976). the functional significance of this response has not been determined. nyctinastic leaves may protect meristematic tissue from frost damage in some high-elevation plants (smith 1974), but their adaptive significance in low-elevation tropical plants is undear (darwin 1881, satter and galston 1971, schwintzer 1971). jungner (1891) was one of the first to regard drip-tips as an adaptation for rapid draining of the leaf surface. he observed that leaves with drip-tips dried more quickly, and were less overgrown with epiphyllae, than leaves without drip-tips. he believed that by facilitating water runoff, drip-tips kept the leaf surface relatively clear of spores of epiphyllae, and soluble substances which might encourage epiphyllae growth. stahl (1898) showed that by removing the drip-tips he could increase the time required for a leaf to dry, but he doubted there was any correlation between drip-tips and the presence or absence of epiphyllae. he instead proposed that driptips functioned to prevent a lingering surface film of water, which would lower the surface temperature of the leaf, which in turn would slow the rate of transpiration by the plant. a low rate of transpiralpresent address: department of zoology, university of iowa, iowa city, iowa 52242, u.s.a. tion, he reasoned, would slow the uptake of mineral salts by the roots, which would be disadvantageous to the plant. shreve (1914), working in the understory in the montane forest of jamaica, was unable to detect any difference in the rate of drying in leaves with driptips removed versus those with drip-tips intact. richards (1966) maintains that shreve worked with plants with atypical, abbreviated drip-tips, and that his results do not therefore disprove the hypothesis that drip-tips have a drying function. according to richards and to edmisten (1970), the controversy about the ecological significance of drip-tips remains unsolved.", "isOpenAccess": false, "fullDocLink": "", "petalID": 331, "doi": "10.1016/J.CUB.2012.12.010", "level1": ["manage_mechanical_forces"], "level2": ["manage_external_forces"], "level3": ["manage_impact"], "isBiomimicry": "Y", "url": "https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(12)01450-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982212014509%3Fshowall%3Dtrue", "mag_terms": ["acyrthosiphon pisum", "predation", "herbivore", "desiccation", "zoology", "botany", "biology"], "species": ["machaerium", "plants", "mimosa pudica"], "absolute_relevancy": [0.013698630136986, 0.034246575342465, 0.006849315068493], "relative_relevancy": [0.4, 1.0, 0.2]},

understanding of the evolution of communication strategies, and by providing insights into physical optics and inspiring biomimetic technologies useful to humans. iridescent colours are found in a broad diversity of animal taxa ranging from diminutive marine copepods to terrestrial insects and birds. iridescent coloration has received a surge of research interest of late, and studies have focused on both characterizing the nanostructures responsible for producing iridescence and identifying the behavioural functions of iridescent colours. in this paper, we begin with a brief description of colour production mechanisms in animals and provide a general overview of the taxonomic distribution of iridescent colours. we then highlight unique properties of iridescent signals and review the proposed functions of iridescent coloration, focusing, in particular, on the ways in which iridescent colours allow animals to communicate with conspecifics and avoid predators. we conclude with a brief overview of non-communicative functions of iridescence in animals. despite the vast amount of recent work on animal iridescence, our review reveals that many proposed functions of iridescent coloration remain virtually unexplored, and this area is clearly ripe for future research.", "isOpenAccess": true, "fullDocLink":

and modulate plant growth in various ways. \u2020scope this review addresses the significance of arbuscular mycorrhiza in alleviation of salt stress and their beneficial effects on plant growth and productivity. it also focuses on recent progress in unravelling biochemical, physiological and molecular mechanisms in mycorrhizal plants to alleviate salt stress. \u2020conclusions the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviating salt stress is well documented. this paper reviews the mechanisms arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi employ to enhance the salt tolerance of host plants such as enhanced nutrient acquisition (p, n, mg and ca), maintenance of the k \u00fe :n a \u00fe ratio, biochemical changes (accumulation of proline, betaines, polyamines, carbohydrates and antioxidants), physiological changes ( photosynthetic efficiency, relative permeability, water status, abscissic acid accumulation, nodulation and nitrogen fixation), molecular changes (the expression of genes: pip ,n a \u00fe /h \u00fe antiporters, lsnced, lslea and lsp5cs) and ultra-structural changes. theis review identifies certain lesser explored areas such as molecular and ultrastructural changes where further research is needed for better understanding of symbiosis with reference to salt stress for optimum usage of this technology in the field on a large scale. this review paper gives useful

(1) a spoonbill does not mainly feed on small, benthic invertebrates, but mainly on nekton such as fish and shrimps. (2) the inner surface of the upper mandible of a spoonbill is not concave but convex. (3) during feeding, a spoonbill does not keep its bill tip close to the bottom independent of the water depth. the outcomes of the tests supporting the hypothesis do not hold and the suggested benefits are dubious. therefore, we reject the hypothesis and the claim that the bill of a spoonbill is used as a hydrofoil. the discussed paper tried to give an explanation of the behaviour of a bird with the help of hydrodynamic formulae. the fundamental mistake in the paper is that the use of the formulae is based on wrong assumptions concerning the food of the bird, its feeding behaviour as well as its anatomical details. the tests with a bird kept in captivity suggesting a proof of the rightness of the hypothesis lack a proper connection to the situation in the wild. spoonbills (aves: ciconiiformes: threskiornithidae, genus platalea) are large wading birds characterised by their extremely flattened bills that are widened in the distal parts. the six species are very similar in shape and behaviour, mainly differing in size, colour of legs, bills and other bare parts, and in distribution (matheu and del hoyo 1992). they feed tactilely by walking in shallow", "isOpenAccess": true, "fullDocLink": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.0908-8857.2008.04299.x", "petalID": 369, "doi": "10.1073/PNAS.0908205107", "level1": ["assemble/break_down_structure", "chemically_assemble/break_down"], "level2": ["physically_assemble_structure", "chemically_assemble"], "level3": ["self-assemble", "chemically_assemble_organic_compounds"], "isBiomimicry": "Y", "url": "https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/12/01/0908205107", "mag_terms": ["kinetics", "crystallization", "supersaturation", "relaxation", "biophysics", "adsorption", "amorphous solid", "positive feedback", "peptide", "chemistry", "crystallography"], "species": ["threskiornithidae", "bird", "aves", "ciconiiformes", "fish", "birds", "platalea"], "absolute_relevancy": [0.012820512820512001, 0.051282051282051, 0.012820512820512001, 0.012820512820512001, 0.012820512820512001, 0.012820512820512001, 0.012820512820512001], "relative_relevancy": [0.25, 1.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]},

life, our vital ability to quickly and effectively learn new words and meanings is neurobiologically poorly understood. conventional knowledge maintains that language learning-especially in adulthood-is slow and laborious. furthermore, its structural basis remains unclear. even though behavioural manifestations of learning are evident near instantly, previous neuroimaging work across a range of semantic categories has largely studied neural changes associated with months or years of practice. here, we address rapid neuroanatomical plasticity accompanying new lexicon acquisition, specifically focussing on the learning of action-related language, which has been linked to the brain's motor systems. our results show that it is possible to measure and to externally modulate (using transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) of motor cortex) cortical microanatomic reorganisation after mere minutes of new word learning. learning-induced microstructural changes, as measured by diffusion kurtosis imaging (dki) and machine learning-based analysis, were evident in prefrontal, temporal, and parietal neocortical sites, likely reflecting integrative lexico-semantic processing and formation of new memory circuits immediately during the learning tasks. these results suggest a structural basis for the rapid neocortical word encoding mechanism and reveal the causally interactive relationship of modal and associative brain regions in supporting learning and word acquisition.", "isOpenAccess": true, "fullDocLink": "https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001290", "petalID": 1441,
